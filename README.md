## 1. Introduction
This project is an application of CSARCH2 topics through the creation of a Custom PC Build. Our group's **target use case** is to create an **AMD-based entry level gaming PC** designed specifically for students and casual gamers. The objective was to delicer smooth performance at 900p and playable setting at 1080p, comparable to an Xbox One's graphical capabilities, without compromising on modern titles and easily maxing out on older titles. The **budget constraint** for the entire build was **PHP 40,000(±5%)**.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: The AMD Ryzen 5 5500 is an AM4 socket processor and is paired with the Gigabyte B550M AORUS Motherboard. This pairing is compatible, as the B550M chipset fully supports Ryzen 5000 series CPUs.
- **RAM + (CPU + Motherboard)**: The G.Skill Ripjaws V 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory is compatible with both the Ryzen 5 5500 CPU and the B550M motherboard, as this chipset utilizes DDR4 RAM. Running at 3600 MHz provides balanced memory speed for the system.  
- **GPU + Motherboard**: The Inno3D RTX 3050 is compatible with the case and motherboard via the PCIe slot. Its power requirement is supported by the Cooler Master MWE Bronze 650 W Power Supply, which is reliable and ready for upgrades.
- **PSU + (CPU + Motherboard + GPU)**: The 650 W rating provides ample power. The Ryzen 5 5500 has a 65W TDP, and the RTX 3050 has a maximum power draw (TGP) of around 130W. The total power draw of the system is well below the PSU's capacity, ensuring stability and providing generous overhead for future upgrades. 
- **Cooler + Case**: The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Spectrum V3 is an aftermarket cooler included for better longevity and overclocking flexibility, and its size is assumed to fit within the Antec CX200M RGB ELITE MicroATX Mini Tower Case.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱40,000  
- **Final Total**: ₱39,430  
- ✅ Within budget
  
*Trade offs:*
- Opted for No HDD → faster SSD. This prioritizes quick operating system boots and game load times using a 500GB NVMe Solid State Drive  for a superior user experience.
- Included an Aftermarket cooler. This improves thermal management for better system longevity and allows for overclock flexibility.
- Selected the RTX 3050. This provides modern GPU features like affordable ray tracing and DLSS at an entry-level cost.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
The completed build is future-proof, affordable, and balanced. It successfully plays today's games at 900p/1080p without exceeding the budget and is built on trusted AMD + NVIDIA hardware with local vendor support. It is perfect for students, casual gamers, and first-time PC builders.
Reflections on:  
- *Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)*: The final pricing was finalized using local Manila vendors (PC Express & Dynasquest), showing that a high-value build is possible using readily available local stock, which also comes with trusted warranty and returns. The total price of PHP 39,430 was significantly higher than the estimated PCPartPicker USD total of $293.96, but we have to note that some prices are not included, and it excluded local taxes, and shipping fees from the US.
- *Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents*: Before the final PC build, there were definitely hard decisions to make on which CPU to use and what components to go along with it. One of the problems our group encountered in a previous build was the lack of stock and Manila based shops for the most compatible PSU which lead to us compromising and making another build.
- *Learnings about PC components and system design*: The group learned to achieve the best value by utilizing smart trade-offs. This included investing in components that provide upgrade paths and modern performance features, while excluding non-essential components like a traditional HDD.
